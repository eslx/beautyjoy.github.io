                        While the edX platform was developed for highly-literate,
                        university students, our work with the platform has confirmed
                        that it can be customized to be made appropriate for low-literacy,
                        Spanish-speaking, adult English language learners. Through participation
                        in edX’s open source initiative (http://code.edx.org/), we have
                        set up our own instance of the platform on which we have full control
                        of the look and feel of the interface, thus enabling us to meet the
                        unique needs of our target learners. More than a simple translation from
                        English into Spanish, we are working towards an interface that will
                        maximize the use of graphical icons rather than the text-heavy navigation
                        that is currently employed. Additionally, we are working towards an
                        interface that will be designed with a far greater emphasis on connecting
                        through mobile devices than the current version which was designed for
                        use on laptops and desktops. The edX team at UC-Berkeley has been quite
                        encouraging with regard to our current and future modifications because
                        of edX’s support of initiatives that increase the internationalization,
                        localization, and mobile access of the platform.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to modifying the platform, we are building courses that make
                        greater use of image, video and audio than is typical of courses currently
                        offered on the platform. The platform’s full compliance with HTML5 means
                        that it can support our move away from text and towards audio, video, and
                        image for all aspects of our courses.

                        While our current instance does not yet fully reflect our future vision, we have
                        already implemented multiple noteworthy modifications that provide an initial
                        glimpse of what can be done on this platform, and the direction in which we are advancing.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            We have changed the look and feel to reflect our own branding as opposed to that of edX.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We have stripped away unnecessary navigation in order to create a more focused interface that fits better on smaller screens.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We have developed a curricular sample that makes use of video on every page.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We have provided audio versions of all text-based prompts.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We have created a sample assessment component that incorporates audio and video.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        We are enthusiastic about these modifications, but we see them as just scratching the
                        surface. During the next phase of the project, we will move towards
                        fully graphical navigation while developing a suite of alternative
                        assessment types, and taking full advantage of edX’s seamless integration
                        of Google Hangouts so that our online learners will have access to oral
                        language practice, ideally with volunteer English language informants
                        from the greater community.
